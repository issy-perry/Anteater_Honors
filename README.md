# Orphaned Giant Anteater Movement Behaviour and Habitat Selection
This is a working repository for my BSc Honours thesis at UBC Okanagan supervised by Dr. Noonan in the Quantitative Ecology Lab. 
The Scripts folder contains all R scripts used in this project for cleaning data, running models, and extracting results with a separate folder containing the scripts for generating associated figures. This folder also includes information overlaying how to download, crop, and save raster data from Mapbiomas.
The Figures folder contains final figures made included in the manuscipt.
